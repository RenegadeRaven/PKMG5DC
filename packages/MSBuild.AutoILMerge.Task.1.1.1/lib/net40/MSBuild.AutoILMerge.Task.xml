            The MSBuild task wrapping (in)famous ILMerge utility. 
            The recommended way of embedding dependencies into the executable is now <b>Costura.Fody</b>,
            but <b>ILMerge is still unavoidable for some tasks, e.g. creation of database-stored MS CRM plug-ins.</b>
            Also, calling ILMerge from a batch file is sometimes hindered by the limitation on the total length of the command line...

            See http://sedodream.com/PermaLink,guid,020fd1af-fb17-4fc9-8336-877c157eb2b4.aspx
            why we don't really know the project directory so you better make sure all paths are absolute.

            Gets or sets the item list containing the library assemblies
            that are not to be included in the merge. They are used to determine the 
            <see cref="P:MSBuild.AutoILMerge.Task.LibraryPath"/> for the lack of a better method.
            With NuGet we can have hundreds potential library directories even if we filter them by platform
            (nontrivial task by itself).
            </summary>
            <remarks>Translates to ILMerge.SetSearchDirectories() eventually with a higher priority then <see cref="P:MSBuild.AutoILMerge.Task.LibraryPath"/>.
